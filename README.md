# ON.Community Governance
Collection of ON.Community Governance Materials 📚

## [ON.Community Forum](https://forum.omgnetwork.org/) 🗣️

## [ON.Community Cooperative on Ethereum mainnet](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/oncommunity.aragonid.eth) 🦅 
### ON.CC Bounty System 💸
>* **ON.Community Cooperative ("ON.CC")** consists of registered ONC members (see below "Membership") who will initially vote on bounty proposals for community resources, make additional membership rules, as well as establish other high-level priorities.
>* **Requests for Reimbursement ("RFR")** can be made via the [ON.CC Finance Application](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/oncommunity.aragonid.eth/0x68db69930aefb0277384865ae92c2cd1acc87145) by submitting a withdrawal in the selected asset for an Ethereum address. For greater chances of success, it is highly recommended to include a multisignature address in such withdrawal request as well as to give a detailed description in the RFR that allows sufficient 'proof of work' to ON.CC members.
>* **Requests for Funding ("RFF")** can be made via the [ON.CC Voting Application](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/oncommunity.aragonid.eth/0xae974ac35f728a51a8b685dda53c675116b2a76b) and if such RFF is approved, ON.CC members shall commit to timely review and decision on any related RFR(s).

## Background

Building on the efforts of OmiseGO community member, Kartsims, who originated a Mission Statement for this community to begin self-organizing around our shared interests and goals for the OmiseGO Network ("OMG Network"), the following materials reflect a design for this  initiative to take definitive form as a *[Chaordic Commons](http://www.chaordic.org/)* to support the OMG Network into the future.

* ***[OMG NETWORK COMMUNITY MISSION STATEMENT](.github/Governance/Materials/Mission_Statement.md)*** 

* ***[OMG NETWORK COMMUNITY PRINCIPLES](.github/Governance/Materials/Principles.md)***

* ***[ETHEREUM COMMUNITY CODE OF CONDUCT](.github/Governance/Materials/Code_of_Conduct.md)***

### ON.Community Members
The following have assented to these organizing governance materials to initiate a Chaordic Commons as the OMG Network Community ("ONC" or "ON.Community"):
